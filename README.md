Netflix clone created with reactJS, firebase and styled-components.

To do:
- Add sign in UI.
- Add like/dislike functionality .
- Add 'Add' button functionality.
- Add User profile drop down.
- Add different pages in header.
- Add seach function.

What I plan to improve: 
- The carousel component currently creates half-empty pages when the page length does not exactly divide in to the number of results. 
(To fix this I will load additional results to fill the page.)
- The modal component current animates with top/left/height/width, will change this to transform if possible to improve animation performancea.
